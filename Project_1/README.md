   https://github.com/shravya-rep/WebTech.git
   cd Project_1
   ```

2. **Open the main page in your browser**

## Description

This project replicates a visually designed web page using basic HTML and CSS. Key elements include:

- **Raw HTML/CSS** written manually in a text editor.
- **Accurate Design Replication**: Text layout, font styles, and spacing should match the reference image.
- **Navigation**: Includes three active links (“About”, “Projects”, “Services”) that direct to specific sections in `page2.html`.
- **Anchored Sections**: Use `<p id="...">` tags to mark each target section.
- **Static Icons**: Social media icons are decorative only and do not link anywhere.
- **Cross-browser compatibility** with emphasis on Firefox for testing.

## Development Notes

- Only the provided 8 images must be used — no substitutions.
- Links must target anchor tags in `page2.html`, scrolling the section into view.
- CSS styling is required and must be included in a separate file (`style.css`).
- Avoid using any external libraries or frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap, Tailwind).
- Tested using the latest version of Firefox.
